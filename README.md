# Archer
Starting out as a RPG, Archer turned into a simple shoot-em-up where the goal is to shoot enemies as they attack you in waves. In partnership with my friend, Alexander Druillard, we leveraged simple 2D sprites and a sprite rotation algorithm to achieve a retro aesthetic with minimal artistic work. We hit the ground running on this project, setting our goals high and learning new technologies in order to meet those goals. 

## Screenshots
Sprites, map tiles, and an in-game shot too.

## Potential Improvements
* Fix the decision making of enemies, currently tend to walk off map
* Improve spawning mechanism for enemies
* Add pause menu/start menu functionality
